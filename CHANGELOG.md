# Changelog

## v0.15.0-dev

Postgrex v0.15+ requires Elixir v1.6+.

* Enhancements
  * Filter bootstrap more efficiently by avoiding loading tables information on startup
  * Only bootstrap new oids during describe: this means reconnects don't run a bootstrap
    query and describe runs minimal query
  * Parse Postgrex 12beta new version format
  * Raise error when :ssl is required and not started in child_spec/1

* Bug fixes
  * Don't encode DateTime, NaiveDateTime or Time unless Calendar.ISO

## v0.14.3 (2019-05-08)

* Enhancements
  * Make bootstrap query compatible with CockroachDB 19.1
  * Improve error message when encoding bad tuple

## v0.14.2 (2019-04-12)

* Bug fixes
  * Fix Elixir deprecation warnings
  * Do not crash when receiving notices during authentication
  * Do not crash when receiving an error (caused by a raise) during query execution

## v0.14.1 (2018-11-24)

* Bug fixes
  * Bump decimal dependency to avoid runtime warnings

## v0.14.0 (2018-10-29)

* Enhancements
  * Postgrex.INET will add a /32 netmask to an IPv4 address and a /128 netmask to an IPv6 address during encoding where `netmask: nil`. When decoding, a /32 netmask (for IPv4) or /128 netmask (for IPv6) will be removed, resulting in `netmask: nil` for the struct
  * Add `:disconnect_on_error_codes` which allows Postgrex to automatically disconnect and then reconnect on certain errors. This is useful when using Postgrex against systems that support failover, which would emit certain errors on failover. This change allow those errors to be recovered from transparently
  * Add `:cache_statement` to `Postgrex.query/4` as a built-in statement cache
  * Support scram-sha-256 authentication from PostgreSQL 10
  * Add `Postgrex.prepare_execute/4`
  * Automatically reprepare queries that faild to encode due to a database type change

* Backwards incompatible changes
  * Invoke `encode_to_iodata!` instead of `encode!` in JSON encoder
  * Remove Postgrex.CIDR and use Postgrex.INET to encode both inet/cidr (as PostgreSQL may perform implicit/explicit casting at any time)
  * Postgrex.Time, Postgrex.Date and Postgrex.Timestamp were deprecated and now have been effectively removed
  * `Postgrex.execute/4` now always returns the prepared query
  * `:pool_timeout` is removed in favor of `:queue_target` and `:queue_interval`. See `DBConnection.start_link/2` for more information

## v0.13.4 (2018-01-25)

  * `:copy_data` query option is no longer supported and data can only be copied to the database using a collectable
  * Query struct has removed encoders/decoders and changed param_info/result_info values
  * Extensions now use a new encoder/decoder API based on quoted expressions
  * The `:extensions`, `:decode_binary` and `:null` options in `start_link` are no longer supported in favor of defining custom types with `Postgrex.Types.define(module, extra_extensions, options)`. `Postgrex.Types.define/3` must be called on its own file, outside of any module and function, as it only needs to be defined once during compilation.
